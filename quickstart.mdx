<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="key" title="Obtain your API key">
    Grab your API key from **Accounts â†’ Settings â†’ API Keys** â€“ it's required
    for authorization. Keep it secure and do not share it publicly.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion icon="rectangle-terminal" title="Choose an HTTP client">
    You can continue with **Postman**, **Insomnia**, or **cURL** (example

## ðŸ“‚ 1. Endpoint Overview

The **Get accounts** endpoint allows you to retrieve all connected accounts in your workspace. Below is the request format:

```http
GET https://api.contas.rdstationmentoria.com.br/rest/accounts
Authorization: Bearer <YOUR_TOKEN>
```

### Headers

- **Authorization**: Use your API key in the format `Bearer YOUR_API_KEY`.

---

## ðŸ§ª 2. Example Request (cURL)

Hereâ€™s how to make a request using `cURL`. Replace `YOUR_API_KEY` with your actual API key:

```bash
curl --request GET \
  --url https://api.contas.rdstationmentoria.com.br/rest/accounts \
  --header "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"
```

<Tip>
  If you encounter issues, ensure your API key is valid and your network allows
  outbound HTTPS requests.
</Tip>

## âœ… 3. Sample Response

    "platformId": "456",
    "description": null,
